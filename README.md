# Student Enrollment and Performance Dashboard using Tableau

This project presents an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that explores **student enrollment patterns and academic performance** across various demographic groups. Built using a subset of the **Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)** and extended with additional metrics via Excel, the dashboard provides educators, administrators, and analysts with valuable insights into how different factors influence student outcomes.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard focuses on:
- Analyzing **average GPA** by gender, region, and other demographics
- Tracking **student enrollment trends** across different modules
- Highlighting potential disparities in academic performance

It allows users to interact with filters and visualizations to identify at-risk groups, monitor performance patterns, and explore how demographic variables correlate with academic success.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: A refined subset of the [Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset)
- **Format**: Excel (`.xlsx`)
- **Modifications**: Cleaned and transformed in Excel to calculate **average GPA per student**, which is not originally present in OULAD.

## 🛠 Tools Used
